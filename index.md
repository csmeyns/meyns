**Chris Meyns is a researcher, philosophy geek, and coffee lover who is into tech and typography.**

Here's my story in brief. Currently I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl/en). I did my doctoral work in philosophy at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and have held visiting positions at [Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca), [Yale](http://philosophy.yale.edu/) and [LMU Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/about_lmu_alt/academics/faculties/fak_10_philo/index.html).

My main work is in early modern philosophy, mind, and metaphysics. I have written on the analysis of imagination, sympathetic action, and Leibniz's views on probability. My doctoral research, _Psychic Individuation in Early Modern Philosophy_ (2015), discusses seventeenth century views on psychic individuation. My current project, _Subject Plasticity_, investigates early philosophical ideas about plasticity.

When I'm not glued to my screen, I like to transcribe dusty manuscripts, or do the odd bit of urban exploring.

Want to say hi? I love that. You can grab me on [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com/csmeyns) or drop me an [email](mailto:c.s.meyns@gmail.com).
