**Chris Meyns is a researcher, philosopher, info nerd.**

Here's my story in brief. Currently I am an Assistant Professor of Philosophy at [Utrecht University](http://www.uu.nl/en). Previously I was a research associate in the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) Project at the [University of Cambridge](http://phil.cam.ac.uk/) and a Postdoctoral By-fellow at [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/), Cambridge. I did my doctoral work in philosophy at [UCL](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and in Spring 2018 I was a Visiting Fellow at the [Center for Philosophy of Science](http://www.pitt.edu/~pittcntr/index.htm) at the University of Pittsburgh.

My main work is in early modern philosophy and history of science. I focus specifically on questions about the mind and information. I have written on seventeenth- and eighteenth-century debates on perception, explanation, and Leibniz's views on probability. My recent research project, _Individuating Minds in Early Modern Philosophy_ (2016), discusses seventeenth century debates on individuation of minds. I am currently working on several papers on perception and information in the early modern period.

When I'm not glued to my screen, I like to transcribe dusty manuscripts, or do the odd bit of urban exploring.
