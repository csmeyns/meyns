## Chris Meyns is a researcher, philosophy geek, and coffee lover into early modern, tech, and typography.

Here's my story in brief. Currently I am a research associate in the [New Directions in the Study of the Mind](http://www.newdirectionsproject.com) Project at the [University of Cambridge](http://phil.cam.ac.uk/) and a postdoctoral by-fellow at [Churchill College](https://www.chu.cam.ac.uk/). I did my doctoral work in philosophy at [University College London](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/philosophy), and have held visiting positions at [Toronto](http://www.philosophy.utoronto.ca), [Yale](http://philosophy.yale.edu/) and [LMU Munich](http://www.en.uni-muenchen.de/about_lmu_alt/academics/faculties/fak_10_philo/index.html).

My main work is in early modern philosophy, philosophy of mind, and metaphysics. I have written on the analysis of imagination, sympathetic action explanation, and Leibniz's view on the moral side of probability. In my doctoral research project, _Psychic Individuation in Early Modern Philosophy_ (2015), I defend a new account of models of psychic individuation in the long seventeenth century. 

In my current research project _Subject Plasticity_, I investigate the early philosophical ideas about plasticity. In particular, I focus on how the concept of plasticity is used to counter the idea that subjects have fixed, intrinsic natures which determine their stable characteristics.

When I'm not glued to my screen, I like code stuff, transcribe dusty manuscripts, or do the odd bit of urban exploring.
